# Prime Generator

This is a tiny Java project intended for a refactoring exercise. This emulates ``Chapter 5: Refactoring`` of the book ``Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices`` by Robert Martin.

The code uses the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) algorithm to generate prime numbers up to a certain value.

## Starting Point

The ``main`` branch has the original code and unit tests, as the starting point.

## Refactored Code

Refactored code can be found in the ``refactor`` branch.
